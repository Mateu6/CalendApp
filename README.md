Hello and welcome to my first portfolio*!

It is an Android app buildable in Android Studio written completely in Kotlin. 
As of now it is mostly front-end based app but it is expandable (I will work on it) to be offline-first full stack project. 
This app helped me understand how Material UI3 works and what it is capable of.


*It was supposed to be my thesis but I have decided not to get my degree at the last semester so here we are.
